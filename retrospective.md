# Project Retrospective — Portfolio Prototype

## What went well
- Defining a clear scope early made the build straightforward: two pages, shared CSS, and a small set of goals.
- Using semantic HTML improved organization and made it easier to style predictable sections.
- Building a prototype quickly helped identify layout issues early (spacing, heading hierarchy, navigation clarity).

## What went wrong
- I initially underestimated how easy it is to miss small repo requirements (exact filenames, correct folder structure, linking to docs from README).
- It was tempting to add “nice-to-have” features (extra pages, JS, animations), which would have increased risk and reduced polish time.

## What I would do differently next time
- Start with a short pre-submit checklist earlier (README links, Pages settings, folder structure, relative paths).
- Add a quick validation step: open the site on mobile width and tab through the nav to verify keyboard usability.
- Plan a small “design pass” as a separate task so visual hierarchy (spacing, section rhythm) is intentional rather than accidental.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Lock scope early and treat “future improvements” as out-of-scope notes.
2. Ship a working baseline fast, then iterate on quality.
3. Use a repeatable QA checklist for every deployment.
