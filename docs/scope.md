# Project Scope Statement — Arnold Archaga Portfolio Website

## Project Title
Arnold Archaga — Portfolio Prototype (2-page website)

## Background / Problem Statement
As a Computing Applications student working toward a professional software development career, I need a simple, credible web presence that introduces who I am, what I’m learning, and what I’m building. A lightweight portfolio prototype provides a clear “home base” that can be expanded later (projects, resume, contact, etc.).

## Project Purpose
Deliver a two-page, responsive, accessible prototype that communicates my identity, goals, and highlights (skills + interests) while demonstrating competency in planning, documentation, and basic web development.

## Goals (Measurable Outcomes)
1. Publish a live, working website with two linked pages using GitHub Pages.
2. Use semantic HTML structure (header, nav, main, section, footer) on both pages.
3. Apply consistent styling across both pages using a single external `style.css`.
4. Ensure basic accessibility: readable contrast, keyboard-friendly nav, descriptive link text, and meaningful headings.
5. Provide clear project documentation in `docs/` that reflects course concepts and PMUPM principles.

## In-Scope Deliverables
### Required Technical Deliverables
- `index.html` homepage
- `about.html` second page linked from the homepage
- `style.css` single external stylesheet used by both pages
- Live deployment via GitHub Pages

### Required Documentation Deliverables
- `docs/scope.md` (this scope)
- `docs/plan.md` (TAME risk analysis + schedule/WBS)
- `docs/retrospective.md` (what went well / wrong / next time)

## Out of Scope (Not included in this project)
- JavaScript features (forms, interactivity, APIs)
- A full multi-page portfolio (projects page, contact form, blog)
- Database, login, CMS, ecommerce, or analytics dashboards
- Custom domain configuration (optional future enhancement)

## Target Audience
- Recruiters and hiring managers evaluating early-career developers
- Instructors/classmates reviewing project management and web fundamentals
- Anyone seeking quick context about my interests and direction

## User Stories
1. As a recruiter, I want to quickly understand who Arnold is and what he’s working toward so I can decide if I should reach out.
2. As an instructor, I want to see clear documentation that matches the delivered website so I can evaluate planning vs. execution.
3. As Arnold, I want a clean site foundation that I can expand later with projects and a resume.

## Functional Requirements
- Site must provide navigation between Home and About pages.
- Home page must include: short intro, focus/skills snapshot, and a call-to-action link to GitHub.
- About page must include: background, interests, and near-term goals.
- Both pages must share the same visual system through `style.css`.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Accessibility basics (semantic tags, heading order, keyboard-friendly focus states)
- Fast load time (no heavy libraries)
- Clean repo organization + professional README

## Assumptions
- GitHub Pages will be used for hosting.
- Content will be short, scannable, and written for professional clarity.
- This is a prototype intended to grow later.

## Constraints
- Two pages only (index + about)
- No external frameworks required
- Must be completed within the course timeline

## Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)
- Repository is public and contains required files and structure.
- `README.md` explains the project and links to live site + documentation.
- Live site loads without errors and pages link correctly.
- Both pages use semantic HTML and are styled by the same external CSS file.
- Documentation clearly reflects PMUPM concepts and matches the implemented result.
